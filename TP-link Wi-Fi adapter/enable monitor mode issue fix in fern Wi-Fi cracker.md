# How to Fix Fern Wifi Cracker Tool Unable to Enable Monitor Mode Issue on Kali Linux

If you're encountering issues with Fern Wifi Cracker not enabling monitor mode on your Kali Linux system, follow these steps to resolve the problem:

1. **Check Your Wireless Interface:**
   First, ensure that you have a compatible wireless network interface card (NIC) that supports monitor mode. You can use the `airmon-ng` command to list available wireless interfaces and their capabilities.

    ```bash
    airmon-ng
    ```

2. **Disable the Interface:**
   Next, disable your wireless interface (e.g., `wlan0`). Use the following command to bring it down:

    ```bash
    ip link set wlan0 down
    ```

3. **Rename the Interface:**
   Rename your interface to include "mon" at the end (e.g., `wlan0mon`). This is necessary for monitor mode activation.

    ```bash
    ip link set wlan0 name wlan0mon
    ```

4. **Bring the Interface Up:**
   Bring the renamed interface back up:

    ```bash
    ip link set wlan0mon up
    ```

5. **Launch Fern Wifi Cracker:**
   Now you're ready to use Fern Wifi Cracker. Open it up and select the newly renamed interface (`wlan0mon`). You should be good to go!

Remember to run these commands with appropriate privileges (usually as root or using `sudo`). If you encounter any issues, double-check your wireless card's compatibility and driver support.

Happy cracking! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüîç
